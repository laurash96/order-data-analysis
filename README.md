# order-data-analysis
Data analysis project for hospital orders of essentials' data to evaluate metrics such as fulfillment rate, top products, top customers, loss due to unfulfillment of orders and others.

### Background:

ZLG.inc is a medical supply manufacturer. The majority of their revenue is generated from supplying medical related equipment to hospitals and charities. However, the company’s supply chain has been significantly disrupted by the economic impact of Covid-19, leading to limitations in fulfilling customer orders. Michael, CEO of ZLG, believes that investing in better warehouse management systems is not worth the capital investment, providing the following statement in a leadership interview: 

“Sure, we may leave a bit of money on the table when we are unable to fulfill orders based on insufficient inventory; however, I am not too worried about it because our products are essentials, and our hospitals will re-order the same product with the same quantity or higher within the ensuing 60 days the majority of the time

### Additional Information:
-	ZLG had acquired a new POS platform in 2022 and transitioned to using it as their primary POS system starting 2023
-	This change in systems has affected the formatting of some data, which potentially can add complexity to the analysis process.


### Objective I
Answer the following Prompts:
-	What are the 10 most popular products numbers 
-	Which 3 clients have the most unfulfilled orders due to insufficient inventory 
-	For these clients, how much money do these insufficient inventory orders account for?
-	What observations can you make about orders placed between Jan through March of 2023 

### Objective II
The task will be to respond to the CEO’s statement using data-backed insights by leveraging the company’s order dataset.
Key considerations – have the same products been ordered by the same hospital with same qty or higher than what was lost in the ensuing 60 days of the original order? 

### Presentation

The results and answers are presented with a ppt (PPT_DataAnalysis.pdf) file and a Looker Studio dashboard https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/31e65539-d570-4d11-9b7d-a2caf2c93d92  used to visually represent the variables and extract insights.
